Basically just run main.py
By default it won't do anything; it operates on HTML sources when they're put into the:
./working_pages/HTML/ 
directory.

Two (real) .html files are provided for demonstration.
They are located under:
./downloadedPages/testcases/

'GrowthRates.html' (from SerenesForest.net) produces much better results
'Hockey.html' (from collegehockeynews.com/stats/team/Michigan/31) is not handled well by the parser,
  I barely managed to scrape it together.
